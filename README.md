# 🛡️ NetworkSecurity - End-to-End MLOps for Phishing Detection

This project implements a complete **MLOps pipeline** for detecting phishing websites using structured URL-based features. It includes data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, experiment tracking, containerization, deployment to AWS (ECR + EC2), and a REST API powered by FastAPI.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal is to build a production-grade system that:

* Ingests data from a MongoDB collection
* Validates and transforms the data
* Trains multiple classification models
* Tracks experiments using MLflow via [DagsHub](https://dagshub.com/)
* Builds a Docker image and deploys it using GitHub Actions to **Amazon ECR + EC2**
* Exposes REST API endpoints for:

  * `/train` — runs the full pipeline
  * `/predict` — receives a CSV file and returns predictions in a rendered HTML table
